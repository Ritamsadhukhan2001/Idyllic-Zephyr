                oldest classical dance heritage of India is regarded as mother of many other Indian classical dance
                forms. Conventionally a solo dance performed only by women, it initiated in the Hindu temples of Tamil
                Nadu and eventually flourished in South India. Theoretical base of this form traces back to ‘Natya
                Shastra’, the ancient Sanskrit Hindu text on the performing arts. A form of illustrative anecdote of
                Hindu religious themes and spiritual ideas emoted by dancer with excellent footwork and impressive

                music and particularly the guru who directs and conducts the performance. It also continues to inspire
                several art forms including paintings and sculptures starting from the spectacular 6th to 9th century CE
                temple sculptures. </p>

            <p class="sectionSubTag text small">kathakali, one of the main forms of classical dance-drama of India,
                other major ones being bharata natyam, kathak, manipuri, kuchipudi, and odissi. It is indigenous to
                southwestern India, particularly the state of Kerala, and is based on subject matter from the Ramayana,
                the Mahabharata, and stories from Shaiva literature. Enacted outdoors, the presentation is an all-night
                function. During the action, voices chant the story as mimed by dancers; incidental dances, accompanied
                by ear-splitting drumbeats, enrich the performance. Traditionally, kathakali is performed exclusively by
                men and young boys who play the parts of both males and females. The dancers are dedicated to its
                practice throughout their lives.
                The movement is vigorous and florid. Stylized gestures and facial expressions follow the rules of
                bharata natyam. Gestures are wide and strong, the pointing of a finger being preceded by a sweep of the
                body and a great circling of the arms. Faces are made up to look like painted masks. The costume
                consists of a full skirt, a heavy jacket, numerous garlands and necklaces, and a towering headdress.</p>

            <p class="sectionSubTag text small">A dance of northern India, Kathak is often a dance of love. It is
                performed by both men and women. The movements include intricate footwork accented by bells worn around
                the ankles and stylized gestures adapted from normal body language. It was originated by Kathakas,
                professional storytellers who used a mixture of dance, song, and drama. Like other Indian dances it
                began as a temple dance, but soon moved into the courts of ruling houses.
                Kathak is the classical dance of north indian style that was characterized by rhythmic footwork danced
                under the weight of more than 100 ankle bells, spectacular spins, and a representation of themes from
                Persian and Urdu poetry alongside those of Hindu mythology. The word kathak means "to tell a story". It
                is derived from the dance dramas of ancient India. Kathak arose from the fusion of Hindu and Muslim
                cultures that took place during the Mughal period. More than any other South Asian dance form, kathak
                expresses the aesthetic principles of Islamic culture.</p>

            <p class="sectionSubTag text small">Manipuri, one of the six classical dance styles of India, the others
                being bharata natyam, kathak, kathakali, kuchipudi, and odissi. It is indigenous to Manipur and is
                characterized by a variety of forms that are linked to folk tradition and ritual. Themes are generally
                taken from episodes in the life of Krishna, the pastoral god.
                During the dance interpretations a narrator may chant dialogue and descriptive action, interspersed with
                choral singing. Manipuri is smooth and graceful and technically easier and more limited than the other
                classic styles. Ankles are seldom belled, and the movement of the dance does not accentuate them, the
                steps being light and close to the floor. A flowing sway of the body and a liquid movement of the arms
                and hands characterize the women’s style; stronger and more forceful movements are used by men. The
                manipuri was popularized throughout India when, in 1917, the poet Rabindranath Tagore saw demonstrations
                of the art and brought back dance teachers to serve in his Vishva-Bharati University at Shantiniketan.

                indigenous to the state of Andhra Pradesh and differs from the other five classical styles by the
                inclusion of singing. Kuchipudi originated in the 17th century with the creation by Sidhyendra Yogi of
                the dance-drama Bhama Kalapam, a story of Satyabhāma, the charming but jealous wife of the god Krishna.
                The dance performance begins with the sprinkling of holy water and the burning of incense. Other rituals
                are performed, the goddesses of learning, wealth, and energy are invoked, and the characters are
                introduced, together with songs concerning their function in the performance. All roles were
                traditionally played by men. As an offering to Krishna, every Brahman, or priest, of the village of
                Kuchipudi is expected to perform the role of Satyabhāma at least once in his life.</p>

                of Odissi is manifested from Odisha Hindu temples and various sites of archaeological significance that
                are associated with Hinduism, Jainism and Buddhism, the sculptures of which adorn dance postures of this
